This is the customized code for extracting data from IDPS (Inscopix) based on time points (e.g., stimulation onset). The code also calculates the z-score of the extracted dataset.

System requirements: Any computer that can run MATLAB

Installation: download code and open in MATLAB

Instruction
1) Download code
2) Open in MATLAB
3) Put file path and file and in 'file_name_1' section
4) Put timepoint in 't_point' section that you want to extract as seconds
5) Run the code

Output files
1) zscore of accepted cells in each timepoints
2) dff of accepted cells in each timepoints
3) Average across timepoints in each accepted cells
